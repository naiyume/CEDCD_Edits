CEDCD Dev Startup

Run the following commands in Terminal. Copy and paste with Ctrl + C and Ctrl + Shift + V.

1)  Clone the git repository
    1.1.    Navigate terminal to where you want to save the project and run the following command (If you are using Windows, git bash works fine)
    
    git clone https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-webtools-dccps-cedcd.git

2)  Go to the root directory
    
    cd nci-webtools-dccps-cedcd/

3)  Install the packages needed for the project
    
    npm install

4)  Go to the client directory
    
    cd client

5)  Install the packages needed for the client
    
    npm install

6)  Now we need to do some setup in the backend side!
    If you don't have mysql installed, then perform the following steps
    First, return to the directory where you cloned the project
    
    cd ..
    cd ..

7)  Clone the portable-wamp from the following git repository

    git clone https://github.com/park-brian/portable-wamp

8)  Enter the folder

    cd portable-wamp

9)  run the setup scripts

    ./setup.sh

10) Open a new terminal (or Git Bash) and navigate to your current location

11) In this terminal, run the sql server script

    ./start_mysqld.sh

12) Go back to the first terminal and first copy some files that we will need later on into this folder
    So, go back to the directory with the two cloned repositories in it

    cd ..

    Copy some sql files over 

    cp nci-webtools-dccps-cedcd/database/Schema/cedcd_Tables.sql portable-wamp/cedcd-dev-20190627.sql
    cp nci-webtools-dccps-cedcd/database/Schema/cedcd_StoredProcedures.sql portable-wamp/cedcd_StoredProcedures.sql

13) Now navigate back into the portable-wamp folder

    cd portable-wamp

    And run the mysql script

    ./start_mysql.sh

    This should lead to a prompt that looks like the following
     _______________________________________
    |Terminal                               |     
    |_______________________________________|
    |                                       |    
    | mysql>                                |
    |                                       |
    |                                       |
    |                                       |
    |_______________________________________|

14) We need to create a new user by typing in the following

    CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

    Replace username and password with the username and password given to you by someone with access to the servers
    We give this user rights by doing the following

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'%';

15) Awesome! Now we need to create the database that we will be using
    We will create a new database using the following command

    CREATE DATABASE cedcd;

    Now enter the database by using the following command

    USE cedcd;

    We need to import the tables and procedures from the two files we copied over into the database

    SOURCE cedcd-dev-20190627.sql;
    SOURCE cedcd_StoredProccedures.sql;

    Congratulations! The sql server is ready to go!
    Exit the mysql prompt with the following command

    \q

16) Now, we need to create the configuration file.
    Go back into nci-webtools-dccps-cedcd folder

    cd ..
    cd nci-webtools-dccps-cedcd

    We need to go into the config folder and add a configuration file

    cd config
    nano cedcd.settings

    Copy and paste the following into the file
    
        'use strict';

        module.exports = {

        mysql:{
            connectionLimit: 100,
            host: 'localhost',
            port: 3306,
            user: 'username',
            password: 'password',
            db: 'cedcd'
        },

        logDir: 'Logs',
        file_path: 'Uploads',

        mail:{

            host:'',
            port:8000,
            from:'',
            to:''
        },

        env: 'dev'
        };

    Make sure that the username and password are replaced by the username and password you used earlier
    Use the following commands to save and exit if you are using nano

    Ctrl-x
    y
    Enter

17) You're almost there!
    Now we have to build the client. First, we go to client folder.

    cd ..
    cd client

    To build, run the following command.

    npm start-script build

    We need to copy the build files into a www folder, so do this by using the following commands

    mkdir www
    cp -r build/* www/

18) Now, we can run the client

    cd ..
    cd ..
    node index.js

    The terminal should display something along the lines of the following

     _______________________________________
    |Terminal                               |     
    |_______________________________________|
    |$ cd ..                                |
    |                                       |
    |$ cd ..                                |
    |                                       |
    |$ node index.js                        |
    |Project CEDCD listening on port: 9221  |
    |                                       |
    |_______________________________________|

19) Everything should be working now, and you can just open up your browser of choice and go to the following link

    http://localhost:9221/
